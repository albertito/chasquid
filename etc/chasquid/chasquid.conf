# Default hostname to use when saying hello.
# This is used to say hello to clients (for aesthetic purposes), and as the
# HELO/EHLO domain on outgoing SMTP connections (so ideally it would resolve
# back to the server, but it isn't a big deal if it doesn't).
# Default: the system's hostname.
#hostname: "mx.example.com"

# Maximum email size, in megabytes.
# Default: 50.
#max_data_size_mb: 50

# Addresses to listen on for SMTP (usually port 25).
# Default: "systemd", which means systemd passes sockets to us.
# systemd sockets must be named with "FileDescriptorName=smtp".
#smtp_address: "systemd"
#smtp_address: ":25"

# Addresses to listen on for submission (usually port 587).
# Default: "systemd", which means systemd passes sockets to us.
# systemd sockets must be named with "FileDescriptorName=submission".
#submission_address: "systemd"
#submission_address: ":587"

# Address for the monitoring http server.
# Do NOT expose this to the public internet.
# Default: no monitoring http server.
#monitoring_address: "127.0.0.1:1099"

# Mail delivery agent (MDA, also known as LDA) to use.
# This should point to the binary to use to deliver email to local users.
# The content of the email will be passed via stdin.
# If it exits unsuccessfully, we assume the mail was not delivered.
# Default: "maildrop".
#mail_delivery_agent_bin: "maildrop"

# Command line arguments for the mail delivery agent. One per argument.
# Some replacements will be done.
# On an email sent from marsnik@mars to venera@venus:
#  - %from%        -> from address (marsnik@mars)
#  - %from_user%   -> from user (marsnik)
#  - %from_domain% -> from domain (mars)
#  - %to%        -> to address (venera@venus)
#  - %to_user%   -> to user (venera)
#  - %to_domain% -> to domain (venus)
#
# Default: "-f", "%from%", "-d", "%to_user%"  (adequate for procmail and
# maildrop).
#mail_delivery_agent_args: "-f"
#mail_delivery_agent_args: "%from%"
#mail_delivery_agent_args: "-d"
#mail_delivery_agent_args: "%to_user%"

# Directory where we store our persistent data.
# Default: "/var/lib/chasquid"
#data_dir: "/var/lib/chasquid"

# Suffix separator, to perform suffix removal of local users.
# For example, if you set this to "-+", email to local user
# "user-blah" and "user+blah" will be delivered to "user".
# Including "+" is strongly encouraged, as it is assumed for email
# forwarding.
# Default: "+".
#suffix_separators: "+"

# Characters to drop from the user part on local emails.
# For example, if you set this to "._", email to local user
# "u.se_r" will be delivered to "user".
# Default: ".".
#drop_characters: "."

# Path where to write the mail log to.
# If "<syslog>", log using the syslog (at MAIL|INFO priority).
# If "<stdout>", log to stdout; if "<stderr>", log to stderr.
# Default: <syslog>
#mail_log_path: "<syslog>"

# Enable dovecot authentication.
# If set to true, users not found in chasquid's user databases will be
# authenticated via dovecot.
# Default: false
#dovecot_auth: false

# Dovecot userdb and client socket paths.
# Most of the time this is not needed, as chasquid will auto-detect their
# location by searching standard paths.
# Default: "" (autodetect)
#dovecot_userdb_path: ""
#dovecot_client_path: ""

# Expect incoming SMTP connections to use the HAProxy protocol.
# EXPERIMENTAL - Might change in backwards-incompatible ways.
# If set to true, this allows deploying chasquid behind a HAProxy server, as
# the address information is preserved, and SPF checks can be performed
# properly.
# Default: false
#haproxy_incoming: false
